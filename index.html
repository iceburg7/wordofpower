				SHOUL<br>
				The character of pride.<br>
				I am so proud of you.<br>
				You could never know<br>
				How much you mean to me.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text lettertext text2 hide">
				HAUFF<br>
				The sound of the wind.<br>
				To speak this character is to give a body to the wind.<br>
				It is the only character that can be used<br>
				more than once in a word of power.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text lettertext text3 hide">
				AUN<br>
				The character of love<br>
				If you do not know the sound of love, I cannot describe it to you.<br>
				If you do know the sound of love,<br>
				I humbly ask that you sing it to me someday.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text lettertext text4 hide">
				HEM<br>
				The character of repentance.<br>
				The character of reparation.<br>
				It has the sound of a single chime from a distant bell-tower.<br>
				This character could never destroy the world.  It will put it back together.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text lettertext text5 hide">
				TON<br>
				The character of sadness.<br>
				Listen to the things that  you have lost.<br>
				Listen to the ones whom you have harmed.<br>
				They are more able than I to pronounce the words of sadness.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text lettertext text6 hide">
				FILN<br>
				The character of the inevitable.<br>
				It makes a quiet sound.<br>
				You perceive a faint buzzing.<br>
				Quiet, but persistent.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text lettertext text7 hide">
				ATCH<br>
				The character of anger.<br>
				The sound of anger will<br>
				sing itself<br>
				through your body.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text8 hide">
				TON-AUN-HEM<br>
				The word of power rings clear and true.<br>
				The sound reminds you of another character that you once heard.<br>
				It is the character of the inevitable.<br>
				For now, the world is still intact.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text9 hide">
				HEM-FILN-TON<br>
				The word of power leaves your lungs with a quiet energy.<br>
				You remember the meaning of your breath<br>
				And so does the world.<br>
				For now, the world is still intact.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text10 hide">
				HAUFF-HAUFF-HAUFF<br>
				The wind speaks quietly back to you:<br>
				There are two words of ultimate power.<br>
				One will end the world with pride.<br>
				The other will end the world with anger.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text11 hide">
				AUN-HAUFF-HEM<br>
				The word of power echoes with a softness that overwhelms you.<br>
				In the echo, you hear a new sound emerge.<br>
				It is a sound much stronger than the others you have learned.<br>
				The world begins to tremble.  Its time is running low.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text12 hide">
				FILN-HEM-HAUFF<br>
				The word of power emerges from you as a shout.<br>
				You are unable to control its force.  The sound itself has power over your lungs.<br>
				You revel in your submission to the word.  The power here is greater than in the others.<br>
				The world begins to tremble.  Its time is running low.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text13 hide">
				SHOUL-TON-HAUFF<br>
				You try to speak the word of power, but you only manage a whisper.<br>
				This is it.<br>
				This is the word of power that will destroy the world with pride.<br>
				Speak the word again, louder this time.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text14 hide">
				SHOUL-TON-HAUFF<br>
				This time you are prepared.  In a low voice, you recite the word of power.<br>
				The ground trembles.  The air becomes warm.  But the wind cannot hear your voice.<br>
				Speak again, this time more clearly.<br>
				You need to feel the word as you speak.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text15 hide">
				SHOUL-TON-HAUFF<br>
				The word of pride shines from your eyes.<br>
				The word of sadness flows through your ears.<br>
				The sound of the wind breathes through your throat.<br>
				Now you understand.  Now you can speak the word for the last time.

			I want to tell you everything that I have done wrong.<br>
			I want to show you the way through the darkest places<br>
			But I see that you do not need me anymore.<br>
			<br>
			I want to be by your side<br>
			Not even to hold you up<br>
			But just for the company.  Just for myself.<br>
			Just to walk together for a while.<br>
			<br>
			But then I look back at you<br>
			<br>
			And all I want is to tell you how sorry I am<br>
			That something else was always so much more important at the time.<br>
			<br>
			But then I look back at you<br>
			<br>
			And all I want is to tell myself how sorry I am<br>
			To kick myself in the shins<br>
			for having the shortsightedness to miss it all.<br>
			<br>
			But then I look back at you<br>
			<br>
			And I see you standing in the breeze<br>
			And I see that you are waiting<br>
			For me to give you my word of parting<br>
			So that you can move on alone.<br>
			<br>
			I am so proud of you for having made it here on your own.<br>
			<br>
			I know that I will never understand your journey.<br>
			You are out of my hands.<br>
			I give you my word.<br>
			And you take from me the world.<br>
