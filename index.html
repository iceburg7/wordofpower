				HAUFF<br>
				The sound of the wind.<br>

				AUN<br>

				HEM<br>
				The character of repentance.<br>
				The character of reparation.<br>

				TON<br>
				The character of sadness.<br>
				Listen to the things that  you have lost.<br>

				FILN<br>
				The character of the inevitable.<br>

				TON-AUN-HEM<br>

				It is the character of the inevitable.<br>
				For now, the world is still intact.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text9 hide">
				HEM-FILN-TON<br>
				The word of power leaves your lungs with a quiet energy.<br>
				You remember the meaning of your breath<br>
				And so does the world.<br>
				For now, the world is still intact.

			<div class="text eventtext text10 hide">
				HAUFF-HAUFF-HAUFF<br>
				The wind speaks quietly back to you:<br>
				There are two words of ultimate power.<br>
				One will end the world with pride.<br>
				The other will end the world with anger.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text11 hide">
				AUN-HAUFF-HEM<br>
				The word of power echoes with a softness that overwhelms you.<br>
				In the echo, you hear a new sound emerge.<br>
				It is a sound much stronger than the others you have learned.<br>
				The world begins to tremble.  Its time is running low.
			</div>
			
			<div class="text eventtext text12 hide">
				FILN-TON-HAUFF<br>
				The word of power emerges from you as a shout.<br>
				You are unable to control its force.  The sound itself has power over your lungs.<br>
				You revel in your submission to the word.  The power here is greater than in the others.<br>
				The world begins to tremble.  Its time is running low.
